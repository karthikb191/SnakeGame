- Snake always moves forward
- When it hits a wall, it tries to turn back. Direction it turns depends on the forward vector of snake and the normal of the collider.
- Use the steering wheel on the bottom left corner to change snake's direction
- Turn entire play area to green to complete the game
- Basic game loop implemented with pause/resume button.
- Board is customizable. can be scaled, rotated. 
- Grid count is adjustable. Use inspector to set the grid count
- Grid filling is done using a persistent render texture. No objects are spawned and there's no extra overhead. Grid count can be a million, there still wont be a performance overhead. But, position isn't tracked properly for such a huge grid count. Adding a slight offet to the UV in shader will help in this case
